# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Apply machine learning to assess credit card risk. Then, evaluate the performance of these machine learning models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Resources: Jupyter Notebook, LoanStats_2019Q1.csv

## Results: (Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models.) 

## Summary: (Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.)
